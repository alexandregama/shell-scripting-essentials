# Shell Scripting Essentials

Different shells are available for Unix, Unix-like, or Linux OS
- Bourne shell (sh)
- C shell (csh)
- Korn shell (ksh)
- Bourne again shell (bash)
- Z shell (zsh)

We can use a Shebang to indicate and interpreter for execution:

```bash
#! /bin/bash
```

To run a shell script, make sure it has execute permission:

```bash
$ chmod u+x your-file
```
